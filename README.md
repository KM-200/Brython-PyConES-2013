Brython-PyConES-2013
====================

My talk about Brython at PyConES 2013

The Brython repository can be found on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/olemis/brython/overview)

The talk was made using the IPython notebook, revealJS and the awesome posts by [Damian Avila](http://www.damian.oquanta.info/posts/hide-the-input-cells-from-your-ipython-slides.html).
